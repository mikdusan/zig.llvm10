# zig.llvm10
Scripts I use to build LLVM 10.x dependency for Zig on various platforms. You'll not need much installed, but packages  like `cmake`, `ninja-build`, `nproc` (via coreutils) are required.

Some prebuilt binaries are available on [gdrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LiA61jXw02W29NcR4CQtsKAi3cQRBMzd)
